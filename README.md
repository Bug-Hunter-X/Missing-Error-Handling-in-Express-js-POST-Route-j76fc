# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling in POST request handlers.  When a client sends malformed or incomplete data, the server might crash or behave unexpectedly without sufficient error handling.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to add robust error handling to prevent unexpected behavior. 

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies (assuming you have a `package.json` file containing express).
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Send a POST request to `/users` with missing or invalid data using a tool like Postman or curl.

You'll likely see an error in the console or an unexpected response from the server.

## How the solution works

The solution adds comprehensive error handling. It checks:
* If the request body is missing entirely.
* If required fields are missing from the request body.
* If the data type of the input is not as expected.

Proper error messages are sent to the client, improving the user experience and preventing server crashes. This is essential for production-level applications.
